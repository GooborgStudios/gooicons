# Gooicons
Making the world a little more gooey, one icon at a time.

## Installation

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/gooicons.css">
```

## Usage

```html
<i class="gooicon gooicon-ICON"></i>
```

## Building Details

We use http://icomoon.io/app/ to construct the font files and CSS needed for the icons.  If you want to generate the font files, simply load the JSON file from this repository into the site and generate.

## Requesting New Icons
To request a new icon, simply create an issue that starts with "Request: " and give a short name for the icon.  In the details, provide as much description as you can -- an explanation of the icon, visual references, why you want it to be added, etc. -- and we'll check it out.  We reserve the right to refuse service, however if you were to [donate](https://ko-fi.com/vinyldarkscratch) to us ($5 USD or more), you'll get a priority request, meaning it will be completed before others and guaranteed to be added.

## PRs for Icons
We wouldn't mind having a few extra artists helping out with the production of the icons.  However, we reserve the right to turn down PRs for any reason.  Generally, we will accept icons that meet the following criteria:
 - Is gooey (which is pretty much given)
 - Matches the style of the existing icons
 - Is mostly solid, no open icons, please
 - Does not match a request marked with the "wontfix" tag
