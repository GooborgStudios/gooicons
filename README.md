## Requesting New Icons
To request a new icon, simply create an issue that starts with "Request: " and give a short name for the icon.  In the details, provide as much description as you can -- an explanation of the icon, visual references, why you want it to be added, etc. -- and we'll check it out.  We reserve the right to refuse service, however if you were to [donate](https://paypal.me/GooborgStudios) to us ($5 USD or more), you'll get a priority request, meaning it will be completed before others and guaranteed to be added.

## PRs for Icons
We're always happy to connect with new talent. If you're looking to help out long-term, please [contact us](https://www.gooborg.com/contact) as we'd love to get in touch. If you're just looking to create a few new icons, we'd be more than happy to review your PRs. Generally, we will accept PRs for icons that meet the following criteria:
 - Is gooey (which is pretty much given)
 - Matches the style of the existing icons
 - Does not have sharp corners; only curves
 - Is mostly solid, no open icons, please
 - Does not match a request marked with the "wontfix" tag
 - Does not use a copyright-infinging base
